Yes, that is correct in most cases. Fluentd uses buffering to handle log data before sending it to its outputs. If one output plugin is unable to send data (e.g., to a target syslog server), and its buffer becomes full, it can cause Fluentd to stop processing logs for other outputs, depending on your configuration.

Explanation

Fluentd works as a pipeline with the following key stages:
	1.	Input Plugins: Collect data from sources.
	2.	Buffering: Stores logs temporarily before sending them to the output.
	3.	Output Plugins: Sends logs to target systems (e.g., syslog, Elasticsearch, S3).

If an output’s buffer is full:
	•	Buffer Overflow: The logs destined for that output cannot be buffered further, causing Fluentd to stop accepting new logs for that output.
	•	Impact on Other Outputs: Depending on your configuration, this may block the entire Fluentd pipeline, even affecting other outputs.

Why Does This Happen?
	•	Fluentd has a single-threaded event loop. If one output becomes slow or stuck due to network issues or a misbehaving target, it can block the event loop.
	•	When one output’s buffer fills up, Fluentd’s default behavior is to stop accepting new logs from all inputs to avoid data loss.

How to Fix This Issue

To avoid this bottleneck, you can tweak your Fluentd configuration.

1. Separate Buffers for Each Output

Ensure each output plugin has its own buffer by using different buffer configurations for each. This isolates issues with one output from affecting others.

Example:

<match **>
  @type copy
  <store>
    @type syslog
    buffer_type file
    buffer_path /var/log/fluentd/buffer/syslog
  </store>
  <store>
    @type elasticsearch
    buffer_type file
    buffer_path /var/log/fluentd/buffer/elasticsearch
  </store>
</match>

2. Increase Buffer Size

If the target syslog server is slow but eventually catches up, increase the buffer size to accommodate the backlog.

Example:

<buffer>
  @type file
  path /var/log/fluentd/buffer/syslog
  flush_interval 10s
  chunk_limit_size 8MB
  total_limit_size 1GB
</buffer>

3. Use Asynchronous Output Plugins

Some Fluentd output plugins support asynchronous communication, allowing Fluentd to keep processing logs even if one output is slow.

Example for Syslog:

<match **>
  @type syslog
  async true
</match>

4. Retry Configuration

Adjust the retry parameters for the affected output plugin to ensure Fluentd doesn’t block the pipeline indefinitely.

Example:

<match **>
  @type syslog
  @id syslog_output
  host syslog.example.com
  port 514
  <buffer>
    retry_forever true
    retry_max_interval 60s
  </buffer>
</match>

5. Use Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)

Consider sending failed logs to a backup location if the target host is unavailable. This avoids blocking other outputs.

Best Practices
	•	Isolate problematic outputs with dedicated buffers.
	•	Monitor Fluentd’s health using tools like Prometheus and Grafana.
	•	Ensure that critical outputs (e.g., logs for compliance) are prioritized over less critical outputs.
