h1. Upgrade Guide: OpenShift Logging 6 with LokiStack

h2. Summary

After completing the following steps:
* Red Hat OpenShift Logging Operator and Loki Operator will be running in version 6.
* Configuration files will be updated to align with RHOL 6.

h2. Prerequisites

* Red Hat OpenShift Logging Operator v5.9 is installed.
* Loki Operator v5.9 (provided by Red Hat) is installed.
* Vector must be defined as the Log Collector.  
  If not, refer to: [How to migrate Fluentd to Vector in OpenShift Logging 5.5+|https://access.redhat.com/articles/6964433]
* Loki must be defined as the Log Storage.  
  If not, refer to: [Migrating from Elasticsearch to Loki|https://access.redhat.com/articles/6991791]

h2. Current Stack

The current assumed stack is a fully managed OpenShift Logging stack using Vector and Loki, including collection, forwarding, and storage.

_This may vary depending on resources, nodes, tolerations, nodeSelectors, collector type, or backend storage._  
Refer to: [Configure tolerations, nodeSelector & resources|https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.16/observability/logging/logging-6.0/log6x-configuring-collector.html]

h3. ClusterLogging Custom Resource

{code:yaml}
apiVersion: logging.openshift.io/v1
kind: ClusterLogging
metadata:
  name: instance
  namespace: openshift-logging
spec:
  collection:
    type: vector
  logStore:
    lokistack:
      name: <Name_of_LokiStack>
    type: lokistack
  managementState: Managed
{code}

h3. LokiStack Custom Resource

{code:yaml}
apiVersion: loki.grafana.com/v1
kind: LokiStack
metadata:
  name: <Name_of_LokiStack>
  namespace: openshift-logging
spec:
  managementState: Managed
  size: 1x.extra-small
  storage:
    schemas:
    - effectiveDate: "2024-06-01"
      version: v13

{code}

h2. Upgrade Steps

h3. Step 1: Install Cluster Observability Operator

Follow the official documentation:  
[Installing the Cluster Observability Operator|https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/observability/logging/logging-6.0/log6x-installing-observability.html]

h3. Step 2: Create and Manage the Service Account

Create the Service Account:
{code:bash}
oc -n openshift-logging create serviceaccount collector
{code}

Bind the Cluster Role to the Service Account:
{code:bash}
oc -n openshift-logging adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user logging-collector-logs-writer -z collector
{code}

Add additional roles:
{code:bash}
oc -n openshift-logging adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user collect-application-logs -z collector
oc -n openshift-logging adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user collect-audit-logs -z collector
oc -n openshift-logging adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user collect-infrastructure-logs -z collector
{code}

h3. Step 3: Deploy the UIPlugin

{code:yaml}
apiVersion: observability.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: UIPlugin
metadata:
  name: logging
spec:
  type: Logging
  logging:
    lokiStack:
      name: <Name_of_LokiStack>
{code}

Apply it:
{code:bash}
oc create -f <above_file>.yaml
{code}

Alternatively:
{code:bash}
cat << EOF | oc create -f -
<insert YAML from above>
EOF
{code}

h3. Step 4: Update the Red Hat Logging Operator from 5.9 to 6

Follow the guide:  
[Updating the Red Hat OpenShift Logging Operator|https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.16/observability/logging/logging-6.0/log6x-upgrading-to-6.html]

Change Subscription Update Channel to:
{code}
stable-6.0
{code}

h3. Step 5: Update the Loki Operator from 5.9 to 6

Follow the guide:  
[Updating the Loki Operator|https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.16/observability/logging/logging-6.0/log6x-upgrading-to-6.html]

Change Subscription Update Channel to:
{code}
stable-6.0
{code}

h3. Step 6: Delete ClusterLogging and Deploy ClusterLogForwarder

Delete the ClusterLogging instance:
{code:bash}
oc delete clusterlogging <CR name> -n <namespace>
{code}

Check no collector pods are running:
{code:bash}
oc get pods -l component=collector -n <namespace>
{code}

Deploy ClusterLogForwarder:
{code:yaml}
apiVersion: observability.openshift.io/v1
kind: ClusterLogForwarder
metadata:
  name: collector
  namespace: openshift-logging
spec:
  serviceAccount:
    name: collector
  outputs:
  - name: default-lokistack
    type: lokiStack
    lokiStack:
      target:
        name: <Name_of_LokiStack>
        namespace: openshift-logging
      authentication:
        token:
          from: serviceAccount
    tls:
      ca:
        key: service-ca.crt
        configMapName: openshift-service-ca.crt
  pipelines:
  - name: default-logstore
    inputRefs:
    - application
    - infrastructure
    outputRefs:
    - default-lokistack
{code}

Apply it:
{code:bash}
cat << EOF | oc create -f -
<insert YAML from above>
EOF
{code}
