Upgrading your OpenShift Logging and LokiStack from version 5.8 to 6.0 involves several critical steps, including transitioning from deprecated APIs to the new ClusterLogForwarder.observability.openshift.io API, updating RBAC configurations, and ensuring all components are correctly aligned. Below is a refined guide tailored to your current setup.

Prerequisites:
	•	Cluster Administrator Access: Ensure you have administrative privileges on your OpenShift cluster.
	•	Backup Configurations: Before proceeding, back up existing logging configurations and resources.
	•	Persistent Storage: Confirm access to supported object storage solutions (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob Storage, Swift, MinIO, OpenShift Data Foundation).

Upgrade Steps:
	1.	Update Operator Subscriptions:
Modify the subscription channels for both the Loki and OpenShift Logging Operators to upgrade them to version 6.0.
	•	Loki Operator:

oc patch subscription loki-operator -n openshift-operators --type merge --patch '{"spec": {"channel": "stable-6.0"}}'


	•	OpenShift Logging Operator:

oc patch subscription cluster-logging -n openshift-logging --type merge --patch '{"spec": {"channel": "stable-6.0"}}'


These commands update the subscription channels to stable-6.0, initiating the upgrade process.

	2.	Transition to the New ClusterLogForwarder API:
In Logging 6.0, the ClusterLogForwarder.logging.openshift.io API is deprecated. You need to migrate to the ClusterLogForwarder.observability.openshift.io API.
	•	Export Existing Configuration:

oc get clusterlogforwarder instance -n openshift-logging -o yaml > old-clf.yaml

This command saves your current ClusterLogForwarder configuration for reference.

	•	Create a New ClusterLogForwarder Resource:

cat <<EOF | oc apply -f -
apiVersion: observability.openshift.io/v1
kind: ClusterLogForwarder
metadata:
  name: instance
  namespace: openshift-logging
spec:
  serviceAccount:
    name: collector
  inputs:
    - name: application-logs
      type: application
    - name: infrastructure-logs
      type: infrastructure
    - name: audit-logs
      type: audit
  outputs:
    - name: default-lokistack
      type: lokiStack
      lokiStack:
        name: logging-loki
        namespace: openshift-logging
  pipelines:
    - name: application-pipeline
      inputRefs:
        - application-logs
      outputRefs:
        - default-lokistack
    - name: infrastructure-pipeline
      inputRefs:
        - infrastructure-logs
      outputRefs:
        - default-lokistack
    - name: audit-pipeline
      inputRefs:
        - audit-logs
      outputRefs:
        - default-lokistack
EOF

This configuration aligns with the new API specifications, defining inputs, outputs, and pipelines accordingly.

	3.	Update RBAC Configurations:
Logging 6.0 introduces changes in service accounts and permissions. Ensure the collector service account has the necessary roles.
	•	Create or Update the collector Service Account:

oc create sa collector -n openshift-logging || echo "Service account 'collector' already exists."


	•	Assign Roles to the collector Service Account:

oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user cluster-logging-collector -z collector -n openshift-logging

This command grants the collector service account the necessary permissions to collect logs across the cluster.

	4.	Verify and Validate the Upgrade:
	•	Check Operator Versions:

oc get csv -n openshift-operators | grep loki-operator
oc get csv -n openshift-logging | grep cluster-logging

Ensure that both operators are updated to version 6.0.

	•	Confirm Log Collection and Forwarding:
Monitor the logs of the collector to ensure it’s functioning correctly:

oc logs -l component=collector -n openshift-logging --tail=50

Look for any errors or warnings that might indicate issues.

	•	Validate Log Storage:
Check the status of the LokiStack to ensure it’s operational:

oc get lokistack logging-loki -n openshift-logging

The output should indicate that the LokiStack is in a ready state.

Additional Considerations:
	•	Deprecation of Elasticsearch, Fluentd, and Kibana:
As of Logging 5.8, Elasticsearch, Fluentd, and Kibana are deprecated and removed in Logging 6.0. Ensure that all components relying on these services are migrated to use Loki and the Vector collector.  ￼
	•	Custom Configurations:
Review any custom configurations or integrations to ensure compatibility with Logging 6.0. This includes custom log parsers, filters, or external log forwarding setups.

By following these steps, you can successfully upgrade your OpenShift Logging and LokiStack from version 5.8 to 6.0, ensuring a smooth transition to the new APIs and configurations.

Subject: Configuring CLF to Forward Logs to Elasticsearch Instead of Loki in OpenShift 4.14

Hi [Recipient’s Name],

Thank you for your inquiry about configuring the ClusterLogForwarder (CLF) in OpenShift 4.14 to forward logs directly to Elasticsearch instead of LokiStack.

How to Configure CLF to Send Logs to Elasticsearch:
	1.	Edit the ClusterLogForwarder (CLF) CR:
In OpenShift 4.14, CLF can be configured to forward logs to external endpoints like Elasticsearch. To bypass LokiStack and send logs directly to Elasticsearch, you can define Elasticsearch as an output in the ClusterLogForwarder CR.
	2.	Sample CLF CR for Elasticsearch Integration:

apiVersion: "logging.openshift.io/v1"
kind: "ClusterLogForwarder"
metadata:
  name: "instance"
  namespace: "openshift-logging"
spec:
  outputs:
    - name: elasticsearch
      type: elasticsearch
      url: https://<elasticsearch-endpoint>:9200
      secret:
        name: elasticsearch-secret  # For credentials and CA cert if needed
  pipelines:
    - name: forward-to-elasticsearch
      inputRefs:
        - application
        - infrastructure
        - audit
      outputRefs:
        - elasticsearch


	3.	Considerations When Forwarding Directly to Elasticsearch:
	•	Authentication & Security: Use Kubernetes Secrets to securely provide credentials and certificates for Elasticsearch.
	•	Data Handling & Index Management: Ensure Elasticsearch is configured for log data ingestion with proper index lifecycle policies to handle log retention and storage optimization.

Key Considerations Regarding Loki, Vector, and Fluentd Integration:
	1.	Handling High Log Volumes:
Vector, the default log collector in OpenShift 4.14, is highly efficient and optimized for high log throughput. It can forward large volumes of data to multiple endpoints, including Elasticsearch and LokiStack, with minimal resource usage.
However, Fluentd, while versatile, has limitations in handling high log rates, especially when acting as a buffer or intermediary. Fluentd’s internal buffering may become saturated quickly under high log loads, leading to increased memory consumption or dropped logs. This is a crucial consideration if you’re planning to route logs through Fluentd before reaching Elasticsearch.
	2.	LokiStack Integration with Elasticsearch:
Loki is optimized for storing and querying log data using a time-series approach, but it does not natively forward logs to Elasticsearch. To integrate the two, you would typically set up a sidecar or use a log forwarder like Vector to duplicate logs to both Loki and Elasticsearch.
Potential issues with this approach:
	•	Increased Resource Consumption: Duplicating logs to both Loki and Elasticsearch increases network I/O and storage requirements.
	•	Data Consistency: Managing log consistency between two different storage backends can be complex, especially with high log volumes.
	•	Query Fragmentation: Teams might need to query logs from both Loki (optimized for log aggregation) and Elasticsearch (better for complex querying and visualization), leading to fragmented observability.
	3.	When to Recommend Direct Forwarding to Elasticsearch:
	•	For High Throughput Needs: Given Vector’s capability to handle high data rates efficiently, forwarding directly from Vector to Elasticsearch without Fluentd as an intermediary is advisable.
	•	For Unified Observability: If FXPCB relies heavily on Elasticsearch’s querying capabilities (e.g., Kibana dashboards) and wants to consolidate logs in a single backend, bypassing Loki may simplify the setup.
	•	Resource Optimization: Eliminating Fluentd in the pipeline reduces overhead and avoids potential buffering issues under heavy log loads.

Pros and Cons of Forwarding Directly to Elasticsearch:
	•	Pros:
	•	Simplifies log forwarding architecture by using Vector’s native support for Elasticsearch.
	•	Avoids Fluentd buffering issues, ensuring reliable log forwarding even under high load.
	•	Provides direct integration with Elasticsearch features like Kibana for visualization and advanced querying.
	•	Cons:
	•	Loss of Loki’s Kubernetes-Optimized Features: Loki’s efficient log labeling and querying specific to Kubernetes contexts would be lost.
	•	Increased Load on Elasticsearch: Elasticsearch needs to be scaled to handle the additional log volume, especially if it wasn’t originally sized for direct ingestion from the cluster.
	•	No Native Log Deduplication: Unlike Loki, Elasticsearch doesn’t inherently deduplicate logs, potentially leading to higher storage usage.

Recommendation:
If FXPCB’s primary observability tools and workflows revolve around Elasticsearch and they have scaled it appropriately, configuring CLF to forward logs directly to Elasticsearch is a valid and efficient approach. It also avoids potential Fluentd buffering issues under high log volumes.

However, if Kubernetes-native log aggregation and contextual querying are priorities, maintaining a dual log forwarding setup (“in addition to” mode) to both Loki and Elasticsearch could provide the best of both worlds, with Vector efficiently handling the forwarding.

Let me know if you’d like further guidance on configuring CLF or optimizing the log forwarding pipeline.

**Adjusted Configuration for OpenShift 4.14 and Logging 5.9:**  
In OpenShift Logging 5.9 (OCP 4.14), the `ClusterLogForwarder` (CLF) API remains stable, but ensure your configuration aligns with version-specific requirements.  

---

### **Step-by-Step Configuration**  
**1. Define Outputs for Loki and Elasticsearch:**  
Update the `ClusterLogForwarder` CR to include both Loki and Elasticsearch outputs:  
```yaml
apiVersion: logging.openshift.io/v1
kind: ClusterLogForwarder
metadata:
  name: instance
  namespace: openshift-logging
spec:
  outputs:
    # LokiStack Output
    - name: loki-stack
      type: loki
      url: http://loki-stack-gateway-http.openshift-logging.svc:8080/api/logs/v1/application
      secret:
        name: loki-stack-credentials  # Optional: Use if Loki requires authentication

    # Elasticsearch Output
    - name: elasticsearch-fxmb
      type: elasticsearch
      url: https://elasticsearch-host:9200
      secret:
        name: elasticsearch-secret  # Must include username/password or API key
      tls:
        insecureSkipVerify: true  # Use only if Elasticsearch uses self-signed certs
```

**2. Create Pipelines to Route Logs:**  
Use **label-based filtering** to isolate the `fxmb` namespace and send all other logs to Loki:  
```yaml
spec:
  pipelines:
    # Pipeline 1: Send ONLY "fxmb" logs to Elasticsearch
    - name: fxmb-to-elastic
      inputRefs: [application]  # Adjust to [infrastructure, audit] if needed
      outputRefs: [elasticsearch-fxmb]
      filter:
        - type: include
          matches:
            - key: kubernetes.namespace_name
              operator: equals
              value: fxmb

    # Pipeline 2: Send ALL OTHER logs to Loki
    - name: non-fxmb-to-loki
      inputRefs: [application]
      outputRefs: [loki-stack]
      filter:
        - type: exclude
          matches:
            - key: kubernetes.namespace_name
              operator: equals
              value: fxmb
```

---

### **Version-Specific Notes for 4.14/5.9:**  
1. **Filter Syntax**:  
   - Logging 5.9 uses `filter` (singular) instead of `filters` (plural).  
   - Use `type: include` or `type: exclude` with `matches` to define rules.  

2. **Loki Output URL**:  
   - For LokiStack (v2.9+), use the structured URL format:  
     `http://<loki-gateway-service>.<namespace>.svc:8080/api/logs/v1/<tenant>`  
   - Ensure the `tenant` field matches your Loki configuration (default: `application`).  

3. **Elasticsearch Security**:  
   - If Elasticsearch uses certificates, replace `insecureSkipVerify: true` with a `caBundle` in the output secret.  

4. **Collector Performance**:  
   - **Fluentd (Default)**: Tune buffers for high throughput in Logging 5.9:  
     ```yaml
     outputs:
       - name: elasticsearch-fxmb
         type: elasticsearch
         # Fluentd tuning parameters
         tuning:
           flushInterval: 5s
           bufferChunkLimit: 8MB
           bufferQueueLimit: 256
     ```
   - **Vector (Alternative)**: Switch to Vector for better performance by setting `.spec.collector.type: vector` in the `ClusterLogging` CR.  

---

### **Validation Steps:**  
1. **Check CLF Status**:  
   ```bash
   oc get clusterlogforwarder instance -n openshift-logging -o yaml
   ```
2. **Verify Log Routing**:  
   - **Loki**: Query logs in Grafana using `{kubernetes_namespace_name!="fxmb"}`.  
   - **Elasticsearch**: Check Kibana for indices prefixed with `app-fxmb-*`.  
3. **Monitor Collector Pods**:  
   ```bash
   oc logs -l component=collector -n openshift-logging --tail=1000
   # Look for errors like "buffer overflow" or "failed to flush"
   ```

---

### **Why This Works:**  
- **Isolation by Namespace**: The `include`/`exclude` filters ensure `fxmb` logs are routed exclusively to Elasticsearch, while all others go to Loki.  
- **Backward Compatibility**: The CLF configuration remains consistent with Logging 5.9/OCP 4.14 syntax.  
- **Scalability**: Buffer tuning or Vector mitigates Fluentd’s limitations under high load.  

**Final Answer:**  
For OCP 4.14 and Logging 5.9, define separate outputs for Loki and Elasticsearch in the `ClusterLogForwarder`, then use `include`/`exclude` filters in pipelines to isolate `fxmb` logs. Tune Fluentd or switch to Vector if throughput is an issue. Validate using Grafana and Kibana.
