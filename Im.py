The function you provided has several issues that could lead to indefinite looping or repeated output. Below are the key problems and their solutions:

---

### **Key Issues**

1. **Incorrect Indentation**:
   - The code has inconsistent indentation, which can cause loops or conditionals to behave unexpectedly.
   - Example:
     ```python
     for node in nodes:
     # Determine the machine set by removing the last segment after the last hyphen
     machine_set = "_".join(node.split('', 1)[:-1])
     ```
     The code inside the loop is not properly indented, which could lead to incorrect execution.

2. **Infinite Loop Potential**:
   - If the loop condition is not properly defined or if the loop variable is not updated correctly, it could result in an infinite loop.
   - Example:
     ```python
     for node in nodes:
         # Code that doesn't modify `nodes` or `node`
     ```
     If `nodes` is not updated or if the loop condition is not properly defined, the loop might run indefinitely.

3. **Unintended Nested Loops**:
   - The code contains nested loops that might not be necessary or might not terminate correctly.
   - Example:
     ```python
     for j, row in enumerate(results, 2):
         for j, cell in enumerate(row, 1):
             ws.cell(row=1, column=j, value=cell)
     ```
     The inner loop uses the same variable `j` as the outer loop, which could cause confusion and unintended behavior.

4. **Improper Exception Handling**:
   - If an exception occurs and is not properly handled, it might cause the script to retry or restart, leading to repeated output.
   - Example:
     ```python
     except Exception as e:
         print("An error occurred:", e)
     ```
     If the exception is not properly handled, the script might continue running in an unintended state.

5. **Unnecessary Recursion or Repeated Function Calls**:
   - If the function calls itself recursively or calls other functions repeatedly without proper termination conditions, it could lead to repeated output.
   - Example:
     ```python
     def some_function():
         # Some code
         some_function()  # Recursive call without termination condition
     ```

### **Fixing the Function**

Hereâ€™s a revised version of the function with the issues addressed:

```python
import subprocess
import re
import json
import pandas as pd
from openpyxl import load_workbook

def get_notes_info():
    # Command to get the cluster_name from oc_whoami --show-server
    cluster_name_command = "oc whoami --show-server"
    cluster_name_output = subprocess.check_output(cluster_name_command, shell=True).decode('utf-8')
    cluster_name = re.search(r"https://([^.]+)", cluster_name_output).group(1)

    # Command to get nodes in JSON format without headers
    node_command = "oc get nodes -o json"
    results = []

    try:
        # Execute the command and capture the output
        node_output = subprocess.check_output(node_command, shell=True).decode('utf-8')
        node_data = json.loads(node_output)

        # Extract node names from the JSON data
        nodes = [item["metadata"]["name"] for item in node_data['items']]

        for node in nodes:
            # Determine the machine set by removing the last segment after the last hyphen
            machine_set = "_".join(node.split('-')[:-1])
            machine_name = node  # Machine name is the same as the node name

            # Skip master nodes
            if 'master' in node:
                continue

            # Simulated function calls for query results
            cpu_query = f"sum by (node) (sum by (node, pod) (kube_pod_container_resource_requests{{node='{node}', resource='cpu', namespace=~'openshift.*'}}) * on(pod) group_left() max by (pod) (kube_pod_status_phase{{phase=~'Pending|Running'}} == 1)) / sum by (node) (kube_node_status_allocatable{{node='{node}', resource='cpu'}})"
            memory_query = f"sum by (node) (sum by (node, pod) (kube_pod_container_resource_requests{{node='{node}', resource='memory', namespace=~'openshift.*'}}) * on(pod) group_left() max by (pod) (kube_pod_status_phase{{phase=~'Pending|Running'}} == 1)) / sum by (node) (kube_node_status_allocatable{{node='{node}', resource='memory'}})"
            query_result_cpu = prometheus_query(cpu_query, node)  # Simulated function call, replace with actual function call
            query_result_memory = prometheus_query(memory_query, node)

            # Get machine set details
            desired, current, ready, available, age = get_machineset_details(machine_set)

            # Append the results to the list
            results.append([machine_set, desired, current, ready, available, age, machine_name, node, query_result_cpu, query_result_memory])

        # Save results to Excel
        save_to_excel(results, cluster_name)

    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        print("Failed to retrieve nodes:", e)
    except Exception as e:
        print("An error occurred:", e)

def save_to_excel(results, cluster_name):
    # Check if the Excel file exists
    if os.path.exists("openshift_clusters_comparison_report.xlsx"):
        wb = load_workbook("openshift_clusters_comparison_report.xlsx")
    else:
        wb = Workbook()

    # Check if the sheet already exists
    if cluster_name in wb.sheetnames:
        ws = wb[cluster_name]
    else:
        ws = wb.create_sheet(cluster_name)
        ws.append(["Machineset", "Desired", "Current", "Ready", "Available", "Age", "MachineName", "Node", "QueryResultCpu", "QueryResultMem"])

    # Append results to the sheet
    for row in results:
        ws.append(row)

    # Save the workbook
    wb.save("openshift_clusters_comparison_report.xlsx")

def prometheus_query(query, node):
    # Placeholder for actual Prometheus query function
    return "Simulated Result"

def get_machineset_details(machine_set):
    # Placeholder for actual function to get machine set details
    return 1, 1, 1, 1, "1d"

# Run the function
get_notes_info()
```

### **Key Fixes**
1. **Fixed Indentation**: Properly indented the code inside loops and conditionals.
2. **Avoided Infinite Loops**: Ensured loops terminate correctly.
3. **Proper Exception Handling**: Added proper exception handling to avoid unintended retries.
4. **Separated Concerns**: Moved Excel saving logic to a separate function (`save_to_excel`).

---

### **Testing**
- Run the script and verify that it produces the expected output without repeating.
- Check the Excel file to ensure it contains the correct data.
